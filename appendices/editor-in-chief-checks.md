## Editor in Chief checks 

Hi there! Thank you for submitting your package for pyOpenSci
review. Below are the basic checks that your package needs to pass 
to begin our review. If some of these are missing, we will ask you 
to work on them before the review process begins. 

- [ ] **Fit**: The package meets criteria for [fit](https://www.pyopensci.org/peer-review-guide/about-peer-review/aims-and-scope.html#package-scope) and [overlap](https://www.pyopensci.org/peer-review-guide/about-peer-review/aims-and-scope.html#package-overlap).
- [ ] **Documentation** The package has sufficient documentation available online (README, sphinx docs) to allow us to evaluate package function and scope *without installing the package*. This includes:
  - [ ] tutorials or vignettes that help a user understand how to use the package and what it can do for them (often these have a name like "Getting started")
  - [ ] API documentation - this includes clearly written docstrings with variables defined using a standard docstring format such as the sphinx, Numpy, or Google formats
  - [ ] README that clearly articulates the function of the package
  - [ ] Contributing documentation that details how to install a development environment and how to contribute to the package
- [ ] **Issue Submission Documentation**: All of the information is filled out in the `YAML` header of the issue (located at the top of the issue template).
- [ ] **Automated tests:** Package has a testing suite and is tested via GitHub actions or another Continuous Integration service.
- [ ] **License:** The package has an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- [ ] **Repository:** The repository link resolves correctly
- [ ] **README:** The package has a README with clear explanation of what the package does and instructions on how to install it along with development instructions. 
- [ ] **Contributing statement:** The package has a contributing.md file that details how to contribute to the package. 
- [ ] **Package overlap:** That package doesn't fully overlap with functionality of other packages that have already been submitted to pyOpenSci
- [ ] **Archive** (JOSS only, may be post-review): The repository DOI resolves correctly
- [ ] **Version** (JOSS only, may be post-review): Does the release version given match the GitHub release (v1.0.0)?
