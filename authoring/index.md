# Python Packaging Guide for Maintainers Submitting to PyOpenSci

These pages contain guides for authoring packages that will go through the
pyOpenSci review process. This includes best-practices and guidelines for structuring
and releasing your code, as well as considerations to take before you begin your
submission.

## Code Style

pyOpenSci encourages authors to consult [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for information on how to style your code.

## Packaging Guide

The [first section of this guidebook](overview) has info for creating and packaging your
Python project for review and release. The guide also includes info on the basic
requirements for pyOpenSci: testing, continuous integration, documentation, etc.

We also have a [section](release) about releasing your package on PyPI, but we encourage
you to wait until after the pyOpenSci review process has finished before uploading to
PyPI. This makes it easier to incorporate changes/suggestions from the reviews.

PyPI also has a [short tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
on how to package a Python project for easy installation.
