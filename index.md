## Why pyOpenSci?
pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through peer-review of 
scientific Python packages. We also build technical capacity by providing a 
curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write 
and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community 
among scientific Python users so that we can help each other become better 
programmers and researchers.

## This Guide
This guidebook contains information for pyOpenSci package authors, reviewers, 
and editors. It is organized into three sections:

### 1. Before Review - Packaging Guide
Contains our guidelines for creating and testing scientific python packages. 
Before submitting a package for review, check to be sure that your software 
meets the basic [requirements](authoring/overview#overview). The section also 
contains recommendations and best practices that might be helpful as you are 
writing and preparing your package.

### 2. Peer Review Process
Outlines the pyOpenSci peer review process. This includes guidelines for 
submitting and reviewing packages, as well as our 

[Code of Conduct](about-peer-review/code-of-conduct). The 
[Aims and Scope](about-peer-review/aims-and-scope) section 
lays out what types of packages we review.
