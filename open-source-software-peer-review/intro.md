# How Peer Review Works

### If you submit to pyOpenSci You Can Also Be Accepted by JOSS
We have a strong partnership with JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software); JOSS
accepts our review as their own. If your package is within JOSS' scope you can 
then submit it to JOSS, linking to the accepted pyOpenSci review. Note that
JOSS won't accept packages that are don't have research applications such as 
API wrappers. JOSS will then accept our review (you will not need a second 
review with JOSS!). JOSS will review your paper and you will get a JOSS badge 
to add next to your pyOpenSci badge of review. And a cross-ref enabled DOI.

## pyOpenSci and JOSS
(is this the right place for this? - this probably should go in the reviewer 
guide and make it super short here)
> You don't have to chose between pyOpenSci and JOSS; You can submit your package to both.

pyOpenSci and [the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/)
are complementary, partner organizations; and you don't have to chose one or the 
other! After a package to pyOpenSci has been reviewed and accepted by pyOpenSci
you can chose to also register it with JOSS. JOSS has [more limited scope](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html)  of the 
for packages that it will review. For instance while pyOpenSci will review and 
accept API wrappers, JOSS won't. 

If your package is accepted by pyOpenSci and in scope for JOSS, JOSS will fast 
track your package through their process given it was already reviewed by us.
Once accepted by JOSS, you now have both a pyOpenSci acceptance and one by JOSS. 
Joss will then give you a cross-ref supported DOI for citation. 

### Why Two Review Processes JOSS and pyOpenSci? 

the pyOpenSci review process is different from that of JOSS in a few ways:
* pyOpenSci is specific to the Python community and thus will enforce community specific python specific standards. 
* pyOpenSci places heavy emphasis on documentation and usability in our reviews and associated standardization of both.
* pyOpenSci builds community around and visibility for it's tools.
* pyOpenSci supports long term tool maintenance.    


JOSS reviews are [more limited in scope](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html) compared to pyOpenSci and the
[submission criteria](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html)
are, in places, less stringent than those of pyOpenSci.
