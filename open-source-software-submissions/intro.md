# An Overview Of the Peer Review Process

## GENERAL Steps of the pyOpenSci Open Peer Review Process
*MAYBE THIS PULLS TOGETHER WHO DOES WHAT*


- **Author submits Pre-submission INquiry:** 
- Editor discusses package scope with author
  - Optional at this pre-submission stage: Editor reviews submission and performs basic checks
  - TIME: ~1 week

- **Author Submits a Package for Review by submitting an issue in our [pyopensci/software-review repo](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new/choose/issues/new/choose).
- **Editor in Chief Reviews Package Submission for Scope and Minimal Infrastructure Criteria** 
- TIME ~2 weeks (or longer if editor requests changes that take the author longer to implement)

Editor finds reviewers for package ~ 1-2 weeks

 **The Review Begins** 
 TIME: 3 weeks**. 
 
- Authors respond to reviews within ~2 weeks of last submitted review
- **Response to Reviews** Authors respond to reviewersâ€™ comments 
within **2 weeks** of the last-submitted review.
