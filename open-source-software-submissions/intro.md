# An Overview Of the Peer Review Process

## GENERAL Steps of the pyOpenSci Open Peer Review Process
There are several components to the pyOpenSci peer review process. 

1. OPTIONAL: package maintainer submits presubmission inquiry. This is wise to 
do if you are unsure of whether your package is in scope. We will also assess 
whether you package has the basic infrastructure needed to enter review during
this phase. 
2. Maintainer submits package for review
3. Editor 

*MAYBE THIS PULLS TOGETHER WHO DOES WHAT*


### **OPTIONAL: Author submits Pre-submission Inquiry:** 
A **presubmission inquiry** is wise to do if you are unsure of whether your package 
is in scope. During this time an Editor in Chief will review for scope and performs 
basic checks for package infrastructure

- TIME: ~1-2 weeks


**These are the basic checks that your package should have prior to being submitted**

```{include} ../checks.md
```


### 2. Author Submits a Package for Review

A package author submit an issue in our 
[pyopensci/software-review repo](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new/choose/issues/new/choose).

### 3. Editor in Chief Reviews Package Submission

This review includings both package scope and minimal infrastructure criteria 
(listed above) 
- TIME ~2 weeks (or longer if editor requests changes that take the author longer to implement)

### 3. Editor finds reviewers for package 

Time: ~ 2-3 weeks

### 4. Once we had an editor and 2 reviewers on board, the review begins 
Reviewers have 3 weeks to return a review 

TIME: ~3 weeks 
 

### 5. Author Response to Reviews

At this point the authors should respond to the review. We prefer that authors
respond within 2 weeks of the submitted review. We also understand that it may 
take longer to actually implement the changes requested in the review. But we
request a response to reviews at a minimum.

The reviewers are encouraged to open pull requests and issues in to help the 
maintainers update their package. But this is not required. 

### 6. Often there is some back and forth between reviewers and maintainers at this 
point. There is no specified duration for this period. Rather as long as all 
parties are responsive within 2 weeks the review shall continue.

### 7. Package Acceptance

Once the maintainers have completed updating the package, the assigned editor 
will ask the reviewers if they are happy with changes made. At this point the 
editor performs one last check on the package. And accepts it.
 
 At this point there are a few final cleanup activities including adding a pyOpenSci
 badge to the package readme. And releasing a reviewed version. But the package is
 accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem.

### JOSS submission

If the maintainer wishes, and their package is within JOSS' scope, they can now
be fast tracked through the JOSS review process (another review is not required 
for this step)

If you want to learn more about each step listed above, we suggest that you read 
through the guides for Authors, Reviewers and Editors below. 

## Guides for Authors, Reviewers and Editors 

Welcome to PyOpenSci submissions. Below, you will find a collection of guides
that will direct you through the peer review process.

* **[Authors Guide](author-guide):** If you are a **package maintainer** who is
interested in submitting a package to
pyOpenSci, check out the authors guide.
* **[Reviewers guide](reviewer-guide):** If you have volunteered to be a
**reviewer** for a pyOpenSci package, you will want to carefully read
through the reviewer guide for guidance on how we run our reviews. Thank you in
advance for volunteering your time to support open science and open source software!
* **[Editor guide](editors-guide):** Editors for pyOpenSci have previous
experience reviewing packages for pyOpenSci. The editor guide
will walk you through the best practices for the editor role.
* **[Editor in Chief guide](editor-in-chief-guide):** The Editor in Chief will
eventually be a rotating position within pyOpenSci held by members of the
pyOpenSci editorial board (once this is created).
