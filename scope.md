## Package Scope

- **Data retrieval:** Packages for accessing and downloading data from online sources. Includes wrappers for accessing APIs.
- **Data extraction:** Packages that aid in retrieving data from unstructured sources such as text, images and PDFs.
- **Data munging:** Tools for processing data from scientific data formats.
- **Data deposition:** Tools for depositing data in scientific research repositories.
- **Reproducibility:** Tools to scientists ensure that their research is reproducible. E.g. version control, automated testing, or citation tools.
- **Geospatial:** Packages focused on the retrieval, manipulation, and analysis of spatial data.
- **Education:** Packages to aid with instruction.
- **Data visualization:** Packages for visualizing and analyzing data.


### Notes on Scope Categories
- pyOpenSci is still developing as a community. If your scientific Python 
package does not fit into one of the categories or if you have any other 
questions, we'd encourage you to open a pre-submission inquiry. We're happy to help.
- Data visualization packages come in many varieties, ranging from small 
hyper-specific methods for one type of data to general, do-it-all packages 
(e.g. matplotlib). pyOpenSci accepts packages that are somewhere in between the 
two. If you're interested in submitting your data visualization package, please 
open a pre-submission inquiry on first.
